# ** This is a VERY badly named repository: it DOES NOT contains a vqvae2, but a simple vqvae, and a vqgan**

# pytorch-vqgan

This is my toy hackable implementation of VQ-VAE and VQ-GAN.

They can be found under their respective directories.

You can also find here a copy of minGPT, and training script to train it on the auto encoder latents.
